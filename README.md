<p>I re-created this app from my old weather project called _Weather</p>
(https://github.com/Makinloot/_Weather)

<p>This version of app is written in React + TS while old was vanilla js and node js</p>

<p>To run this app locally you need to:</p>
<p>• Get Weather api key from https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/</p>
<p>• Create settings.json file in root directory</p>
<p>• Add following object in settings.json:</p>
  {"WEATHER_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
